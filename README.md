# Data Structures Study
This is a simple and generic implementation of as much data structures as I can fit into a small library, in C++. I'm doing this for studying purposes and later usage in algorithm practice.

All of these structures are generic and use templates. Whenever I finish a structure, I'll write a small section here about it, including time complexity and maybe some implementation details.

Remember: this is a learning project (mainly for C++ practice) so take every line of code you see with a grain of salt! :)
